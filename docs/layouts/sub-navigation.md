This layout offers a page with sub navigation, appearing to the left of content on wider viewports, and above on narrower ones.

To use this layout, make `sub-navigation` the value for a pageâ€™s `layout` key:

```yaml

```

Use [common front matter options](/layouts#common-front-matter-options) to customise which items and content appear within a page.
